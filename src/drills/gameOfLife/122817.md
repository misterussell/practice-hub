# Flexible Grid's with CSS Grid and React State Management
I'm working a little side project where I am building Conway's Game of Life with JavaScript and React, see [Part I](https://medium.com/@MisteRussell/optimizing-conways-game-of-life-in-javascript-part-i-a237039e3d26) and [Part II](https://medium.com/@MisteRussell/optimizing-conways-game-of-life-in-javascript-part-ii-8cdbb1a972ab) for the process so far. I've completed most of the logic and will be swapping between implementing the visuals and stateful login in React to finish this up. In this post I will be discussing how I am using a CSS grid for the view of the cells that can be selected, and then set into their lifecycle.

### Why am I using CSS grid?
This is my first exposure to `CSS grid` so I am using this is a learning opportunity. I attempted first to get this working with floats/inline-blocks but no dice there. I kept ending up with either hard to manage floating cells, or trailing cells because of the constant changes when editing the number of cells on the screen.

In this scenario the user is presented with a `5x5` grid that they can then `add` or `remove` to cells from. This gives them a bit more flexibility in creating the seed for their game's lifecylce. Initially I'm limiting them to a min of `5x5` and a max of `15x15`. This will likely change when I've been able to test to my satisfaction.

### Side Notes
I say this is a `flexible` grid, in that the grid change change the number of cells. I am not referring to a responsive layout optimized for mobile devices. I have not implemented a state-management tool, but am relying on `React's` state management to execute what I want to see.

This was an educational exercise and went beyond teaching me CSS grid. Recently I've switched from using `React.createClass` to extending a `React Component` class. There are a couple of syntactical and property access differences that I will discuss briefly here because of this change.

In this post I will only be discussing how I was able to create a Grid that dynamically changes along with `state`, and the challenges in getting this to work correctly with multiple components. I have not implemented functionality and unidirectional state management for the game at this time.

### The Grid
A grid is composed of two things: a `container` and its `cells`. In `React` distinct features can generally be broken out into their own components. I start by getting components up and running with hard coded `divs` first. Hard coding in the CSS styling helped me figure out the path to dynamically generating the styling.
```
render () {
  const containerStyle = {
    width: `500px`,
    gridTemplateColumns: `100px 100px 100px 100px 100px`
    gridTemplateRows: `100px 100px 100px 100px 100px`
  }
  return (
    <div className={ `container` } style={ containerStyle }>
      { cells }
    </div>
  );
}
```
- `cells` is just an array of simple `divs` to get me started

Now, as mentioned, I know that my `min` number of cells is 5, so I can store that in `state`. That number ties into my hard coded 5 columns, `100px` wide, and 5 rows, `100px` tall. In addition to this, I know that my grid is going to be `500px` wide, regardless of the number of cell the user adds so I can go ahead and add that to `state` too, should I want to change it later. The number of cells a user wants to add, `userBound`, can also be tracked with `state`.
