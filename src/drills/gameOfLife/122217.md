# Optimizing Conway's Game of Life in JavaScript - Part II

In [Part I](https://medium.com/@MisteRussell/optimizing-conways-game-of-life-in-javascript-part-i-a237039e3d26) I tackled solving the Puzzle of Conway's way of life iteratively through arrays. I had a few idea's of the direction that I wanted to go and after working through this further some of my assumptions were correct. Largely the code looks completely different, and I hope, improved. It looks cleaner to me at least. Here was my expected process:

## Process
1. <strike>Get the program to correctly generate new generations</strike>
2. Optimize the program so that it isn't wastefully processing
3. Change the structure of the Life maps from a 2D config to a toroidal config
4. Wireframe / Plan Visuals
5. Deploy to a React app

I was able to successfully generate each subsequent generation with the array methods. My next goal was to tackle "optimization" as best I could. The initial array's that I'm starting with are small, so optimizing in this scenario is moving away from array enumeration. Semantics, right?

Before changing the model of my data, I will note, that it was quite easy to change the initial function from a `for` loop to a recursive function. This pleases me, because I sometimes struggle with recursion.

### Changing the data
I made drastic shifts to the form of the data and how it is stored, and some minor adjustments to what I wanted to keep track of for each cell.

####
Initially I had created array maps of more complicated cell structures with a Constructor:
```
function Cell(x, y, cellState, neighbors = 0) {
   this.x = x;
   this.y = y;
   this.hash = (this.x * 15486047) + (this.y * 15487429);
   this.isAlive = cellState;
   this.neighbors = neighbors
 }
 ```
 This let me save and access properties that I thought I would need. I only ended up needing two of these properties, `isAlive` and `neighbors`. The value `isAlive` kept track of if the cell was a `true` or `false`, and `neighbors` kept track of calculated value where any adjacent cells were also alive.

 In an effort to continue learning new syntax I changed my cell generator from a `constructor` to a `factory`.
