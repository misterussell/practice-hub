# Practice Hub
This repo is a centralized location for me to store puzzle/practice JavaScript. I'm finding that recently I need to version control my practice more often. Because of this it is difficult to keep up with gists.

- Practice files will typically be vanilla.
- Blog posts relevant to specific puzzles/practice will be stored in the directory for that puzzle.
